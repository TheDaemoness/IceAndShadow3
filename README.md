# Ice and Shadow III
__A brutal post-endgame dimension mod for Minecraft 1.15.2 + Fabric.__

[![Gitter Link](https://badges.gitter.im/IceAndShadow3/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/IceAndShadow3/community)

This is a port of the rewrite of the rewrite of the original Ice and Shadow mod to both rework its content and be a bit more future-proof for a change.

Adds a new cold, dark, and highly hostile dimension to Minecraft.
Its entry requirements and offerings make it a potential long-term destination after finishing most of vanilla Minecraft's progression.
Indefinite survival is possible, though survival on Nyx comes with unique challenges.
