_Here be Navistra-scaled dragons. This mod is heavily WIP and should be considered entirely unfit for purpose until version 0.1.0.0, and mostly incomplete until version 1.0.0.0_

_Until then, this every 0.0.x version should be considered backward-incompatible, and every 0.0.0.x version forwards-incompatible._

# Ice and Shadow III
__A brutal post-endgame dimension mod for Minecraft 1.13 + Forge.__

This is a rewrite of the rewrite of the original Ice and Shadow mod to both rework its content and be a bit more future-proof for a change.

Adds a new cold, dark, and highly hostile dimension to Minecraft.
Its entry requirements and offerings make it a potential long-term destination after finishing most of vanilla Minecraft's progression.
Indefinite survival is possible, though survival on Nyx comes with unique challenges.

## Getting Started

## Building/Editing

The contents of this repository should be placed in the `src` folder in your Forge MDK.

IaS3 is written partially in Java 8, partially in Scala 2.12.
To build properly, you will need to add `apply plugin: 'scala'` to your `build.gradle` add a dependency on a scala standard library, and otherwise fiddle.
