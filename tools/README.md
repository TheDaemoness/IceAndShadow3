# Developer Scripts

Quick, dirty, and fragile Perl (i.e. Perl 5) scripts to speed up certain tasks associated with creating IaS3.

These scripts are intended to be run from the project root directory
(one up from the one this README is in).

## add_item_default.pl
Generates a default item model file.

## add_block_*.pl
Generates default `blockstate`, `models/block`, and `models/item` files, as follows:

* **default**: A full cube.
* **deco**: Two intersecting panes, like grass or sugar cane.
