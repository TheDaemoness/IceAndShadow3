# .util

Contains classes that are predominantly unrelated to IaS3 in specific.
If it could be split off into a separate general-utilities library, it goes here.

Some of this code has been salvaged by TheDaemoness from what she wrote for IaS2,
and contributed under IaS3's current license with her permission.
