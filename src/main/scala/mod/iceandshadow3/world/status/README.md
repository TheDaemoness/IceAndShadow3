# .world.status

Implementations of new status effects (which are disassociated from any particular domain).

Remember to add new status effects to `mod.iceandshadow3.compat.entity.Statuses`.
Note that currently, the displayed texture varies with the order of initialization due to a static counter variable.
The textures themselves should be 18x18 and placed in `textures/status.png`.
