# .forge.handlers

Event handlers that are NOT BEventBait subtypes.

These handlers are also not subject to the same restrictions as BEventBait handlers.

Note that some mod-content-specific functionality does show up in here.
This is permissible, although objects obtained from events should ideally be wrapped ASAP.
