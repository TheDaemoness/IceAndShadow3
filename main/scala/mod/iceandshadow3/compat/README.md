# .compat

Package with classes that make heavy references to Minecraft's types, or that need to access/provide package-visible fields of Minecraft types.

Files in this package (including subpackages) may use any otherwise restricted type, though there is a ban on inheriting from anything in `net.minecraftforge`.
